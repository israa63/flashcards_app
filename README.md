* description Flash cards app 
Flashcards are a great tool when you want to memorize a new topic or learn a new
language. You write a question on the front of the card and the answer on the back of
the card. Then you can test your memory by going through the flashcards. The more
often you show a card to yourself, the better your chances of memorizing its content.
With Django, you can build your own flashcards app.

“In [the Leitner system], flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the
learner knows each one in Leitner’s learning box. The learners try to recall the solution
written on a flashcard. If they succeed, they send they send the card to the next group. If they fail,
they send it back to the first group. (Source)”
